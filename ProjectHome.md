Experiments in applying evolutionary algorithms, neural networks and other AI/CI/ML algorithms to Super Mario Bros.

MarioAI is a benchmark for machine learning and artificial intelligence based on Super Mario Bros.

Check out the running Mario AI Championship 2010 at http://www.marioai.org !

_NEW: Turing test track on CIG 2012 Coming!_

# What? #
This is an open source software for AI, Machine Learning algorithms benchmarking, written in Java. Coupled with [AmiCo](http://amico.karakovskiy.com) library allows agents and learning algorithms implemented in Java, C++, Python.
This software suits for research, teaching and self-learning.
Starting from very simple examples you have ability to dive into very complex tasks.
JNI is going to be supported fairly soon.

# Why? #
Got bored another day from walking just the mazes or balancing even the double pole. Came up with idea to create a universal benchmark with simple interface and entertaining content.


# When? #
This project was started in March 2009. Mario AI Competition 2009 took place @ ICE-GIC in London on August, 24th and CIG in Milano on September, 7th, 2009.
